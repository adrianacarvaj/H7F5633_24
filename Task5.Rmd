#Task5.1 Function to calculate ratio mean/median of a vector x
mean_median_ratio <- function(x) {
  # Calculate mean of the vector, removing NA values
  mean_val <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Calculate median of the vector, removing NA values
  median_val <- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Calculate the ratio of mean to median
  ratio <- mean_val / median_val
  
  return(ratio)
}
#to call the function use mean_median_ratio(any_vector)
#
#Task5.2
mean_ignoring_extremes <- function(x) {
  # Remove the lowest and highest values
  x_trimmed <- x[x != min(x) & x != max(x)]
  
  # Calculate the mean of the remaining values, removing NA
  mean_val <- mean(x_trimmed, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  return(mean_val)
}
#to call the function use mean_ignoring_extremes(any_vector)
#
#Task5.3
#Pipes (%>%) improve code readability by chaining operations but should be avoided for functions that use the current environment or lazy evaluation. Use pipes between linear, simple steps, no more than 10. Avoid for multiple inputs/outputs or graphs with complex dependency structure.
#
#Task5.4
#The apply family (apply, lapply, sapply, tapply.) allows iteration over lists, matrices, or data frames. It is preferred to loops. They simplify code applying functions across elements, rows, or columns. Useful to work with large data sets.
