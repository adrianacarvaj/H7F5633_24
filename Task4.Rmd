2. CO2 {datasets}	R Documentation
Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
Description
The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.

Usage
CO2
Format
An object of class c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame") containing the following columns:

Plant
an ordered factor with levels Qn1 < Qn2 < Qn3 < ... < Mc1 giving a unique identifier for each plant.

Type
a factor with levels Quebec Mississippi giving the origin of the plant

Treatment
a factor with levels nonchilled chilled 

conc
a numeric vector of ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L).

uptake
a numeric vector of carbon dioxide uptake rates (μmol/m2 sec).

Details
The CO2 uptake of six plants from Quebec and six plants from Mississippi was measured at several levels of ambient CO2 concentration. Half the plants of each type were chilled overnight before the experiment was conducted.

This dataset was originally part of package nlme, and that has methods (including for [, as.data.frame, plot and print) for its grouped-data classes.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
